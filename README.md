## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic and
algorithmic technique. It is designed for learning, practicing, and mastering data structures and algorithms in Java,
with a focus on clean, readable, and efficient code.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Main source folder containing all problem solutions, grouped by topic:
    - `array/`, `backtracking/`, `binarySearch/`, `binaryTree/`, `bitManipulation/`, `design/`, `dynamicProgramming/`,
      `Greedy/`, `hashMap/`, `linkedList/`, `Math/`, `matrix/`, `numberTheory/`, `prefixSum/`, `priorityQueue/`,
      `slidingWindow/`, `Sorting/`, `stack/`, `string/`, `tree/`, `twoPointers/`, etc.
        - Each topic folder contains subfolders for individual problems (e.g., `problem121/`, `problem118/`,
          `problem955/`), each with its own Java solution file (typically `Solution.java`).
- **LeetcodePractice.iml**: IntelliJ IDEA project module file.
- **.gitignore**: Standard ignores for Java, IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code, and macOS.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pvdev1805/LeetcodePractice.git
   ```
2. **Open in your preferred IDE:**
    - Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions.
    - Import as a Java project. The `src` folder is the main source root.
3. **Run a solution:**
    - Navigate to the desired problem folder (e.g., `src/array/problem121/`).
    - Open `Solution.java` and run the `main` method (if present) or use the class in your own test harness.
    - No build tool (Maven/Gradle) is required; this is a pure Java source collection.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Style:**
    - Use clear, consistent Java style. Add comments where helpful.
    - Name classes as `Solution.java` unless the problem requires otherwise.
- **Adding Solutions:**
    - Place new solutions in the appropriate topic/problem folder.
    - If the folder does not exist, create it following the existing structure.
- **Pull Requests:**
    - Describe your changes clearly.
    - Reference the LeetCode problem number and title.
- **Issues:**
    - Report errors, suggest improvements, or request new problems via GitHub Issues.
